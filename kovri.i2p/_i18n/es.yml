  main_para1: Kovri is a free, decentralized, anonymity technology developed by Monero.
  main_para2: Currently based on I2P’s open specifications, Kovri uses both garlic encryption and garlic routing to create a private, protected overlay-network across the internet. This overlay-network provides users with the ability to effectively hide their geographical location and internet IP address.
  main_para3: Essentially, Kovri covers an application’s internet traffic to make it anonymous within the network.
  main_para4: A lightweight and security-focused router, Kovri is fully compatible with the I2P network. An alpha version of Kovri is in the works.
  main_para5: Watch development via the Kovri repo and join the community.

get-started:
  intro1: A quickstart guide for getting Kovri up and running. For further information on any topic, please see the
  intro2: documentation.
  support: 1. Contact & Support
  support_para1: First off, if you run into trouble on any of these steps, it's useful to know where you can find help. Please go to our
  support_para2: IRC channel for general Kovri inquiries and our
  support_para3: channel for questions that are development related. Ask your question and be patient as you wait for an answer.
  download: 2. Download Kovri
  download_para1: Download one of the binaries
  download_para2: or build from source (see the
  download_para3: Building section
  download_para4: in the documentation for details).
  firewall: 3. Open NAT/Firewall
  firewall_para1: Kovri should randomly generate a new port to use on startup, but if you want to choose your own, you can go to kovri.conf and set any port between 9111 and 30777. See the
  firewall_para2: User Guide
  firewall_para3: in the documentation for more details.
  opsec: Stop! Let's talk about Operational Security (Opsec)
  opsec_para: Kovri can help keep you anonymous to a point, but it can't defend against user error. For this reason, we recommend a few opsec-related housekeeping things.
  opsec_list1: Make a designated user for running Kovri, and ONLY run Kovri using that user.
  opsec_list2-1: We recommend using Linux, and a even then consider using a hardened kernel (such as
  opsec_list2-2: grsec
  opsec_list2-3: with RBAC)
  opsec_list3-1: After installing the appropriate resources in your kovri data path, consider setting appropriate access control with
  opsec_list3-2: ", or whatever your OS uses for ACL."
  opsec_list3-3: "Note: see kovri.conf to find your data path for Linux/OSX/Windows"
  opsec_list4: Never share your port number with anyone as it will effect your anonymity!
  tunnels: 5. Set up Tunnels
  tunnels_para1: There's two types of tunnels, client and server. Client tunnels are used to connect to other services and server tunnels are used if you want to host your own services. To learn how to add or remove tunnels, read the
  tunnels_para2: User Guide
  tunnels_para3: for details.
  run: 6. Run Kovri
  run_para1: Here you are. You're almost done. Now the only thing left to do is to run
  run_para2: in your terminal. Once connected, it should take about 5 minutes to bootstrap into the network and start using services, so be patient. Remember to
  run_para3: report any bugs
  run_para4: if you run into any trouble. See? That wasn't so hard, was it? Have fun!
